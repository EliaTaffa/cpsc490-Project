Title: Encoding Information in a Border
Adviser: Holly Rushmeier

This project is meant to expand off of previous work by Qingyang Chen in conjuction with Holly Rushmeier. His project focused on storing animations in a 2D barcode or QR code affiliated with an object, in which information was stored in the barcode describing how to generated an animation from a picture of the affiliated object. This approach proved especially effective when manipulating 2D objects, with potential use cases being billboards or posters.

To capitalize on this strength, I've developed a new form of 2D barcode that takes the form of a border around an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper. This approach is more intuitive than a more general barcode as it provides the bounds in which the 2D image can appear and makes it clear to the user what needs to be included in their photo of the object by providing a border.

A weakness in the original design lays in the restrictions placed on the user. The photo of the object needs to be taken from a specific angle or the final result suffers in quality. My novel barcode provides timing and alignment patterns that can be used to distort the image into a consistent view, negating to some extent these restrictions. My barcode can easily be integrated with the animation storing algorithm to increase the angle at which these photos can be taken.
